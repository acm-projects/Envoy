# Envoy 🎓
The rise of virtual learning has changed our way of obtaining new knowledge but many roadblocks exist in the world of online education. Many good tutorials or online resources can be in a different language. Envoy is a website that helps people learn from online videos get access to content they may not be able to understand. You can get translated versions of the best tutorial videos and bridge the gap in virtual learning.
 
## MVP ❗
* Accessible website UI/UX to show translated and educational content
* Upload videos/documents to be translated
 * store previous content
* Provide user with subtitles or a version of the document in selected language (Start with English, Hindi, Mandarin, as well as some languages that are underrepresented.)
  * Take English spoken video, provide Hindi or Mandarin subtitles and vice versa
* Take generated subtitles and use Text-to-Speech to completely translate a video
* Interactive elements to deepen learning
  * points for each user
  * dynamic fun fact word translation
 
## Stretch Goals
* Create public library of all users uploaded content
* Create pre-curated categories of learning material
 * quizzes and small assignments
* collaborative feature where people can make suggestions for errors in the translations
* Add portions of textbooks / other resources to make them more Accessible
